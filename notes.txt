# 3 days learned about Redis to integrate it to project, but at this moment i understood that it is early yet

# the next step is to create a new microservice Profile or anything else and to give a try to interact with our
# microservice to-do, we will use
#   - requests,
#   - asynchronous requests,
#   - nested bodies,
#   - will work more with DB
#   - will work more with docker
#   - add more apis to to-do service and new service
#   - second microservice will be on Tortoise ORM
